https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/latest (win64 version)

2. Place UPX.exe in the [distro/src/Dllama] folder or make it accessable from
   a global path

3. Have a successful build, [distro/src/Dllama/dllama-compress.cmd] will fire as a
   post-build event to compress the Dllama.dll to smallest possible size.
